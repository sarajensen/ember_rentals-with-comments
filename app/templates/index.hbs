<!-- to hook up the object literal information in the model (app/routes/index.js) one mush enter the code below:  Note: {{#each}} is an ember helper that alows one to loop through evert 'rental' object within the model using the model(){return rentals} function in index.js. #Each notation followed by 'model' signals to Ember that you're accessing the model hook in your route handler. In loop notation, the |info| in the bars must be an array or objects in a class. The var rentals in index.js is plural, and the rental in the bars is singular, per standard loop notation in ember.-->
